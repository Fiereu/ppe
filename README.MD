# PokeMMO Packet Editor

[![](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/SQwGXyY2gz)](https://discord.gg/SQwGXyY2gz)

## How to Use
1. Download the latest release from the releases page. 
2. Edit your Hosts file to redirect the PokeMMO server to your local machine.
```
127.0.0.1     loginserver.pokemmo.com
```
3. Run PokeMMO by clicking Game -> Start
4. Start the proxy by clicking Start Server

You can now use the client normally and the proxy will intercept all packets sent to the server.
